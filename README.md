This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Hello, this is the fake lex course manager, aka "flex course manager".

in this application you can create a user with a bio, and image, and you can also
subscribe to courses that you would like to take.

if you don't see the course that you are looking for, you can add a course to the
collection.

To run the app, you must run "npm install && npm start". This application runs on a
Ruby on Rails backend server, which by default also runs on "localhost:3000", so be sure
to run one of them on a different port.

Currently the functionality is limited to that which is described above, but I will
be implementing course quiz functionality in a few days.

This application is also available on my github, "github.com/koartim".
